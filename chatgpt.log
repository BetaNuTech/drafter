1> In Rails how can you fetch a single rendom record from a ActiveRecord collection?

You can use the `order()` and `limit()` methods to fetch a single random record from an ActiveRecord collection in Rails. Here is how you can do it:

```ruby
random_record = Model.order("RANDOM()").limit(1).first
```

In this code, `Model` is the name of your ActiveRecord model class. The `order()` method sorts the records in a random order using the `RANDOM()` function (which generates a random number for each record), and the `limit()` method limits the result to only one record. Finally, the `first` method is used to fetch the first (and only) record from the result.

Note that the syntax may differ depending on the database you are using. For example, if you are using MySQL, you can replace `RANDOM()` with `RAND()` to achieve the same result.

2> In Rails how can you fetch a single rendom record from a ActiveRecord collection using the 'sample' method?

You can use the `sample` method to fetch a single random record from an ActiveRecord collection in Rails. Here is how you can do it:

```ruby
random_record = Model.all.sample
```

In this code, `Model` is the name of your ActiveRecord model class. The `all` method is used to retrieve all records from the database and the `sample` method picks a random record from the collection.

Note that the `sample` method is not efficient for large collections as it retrieves all records from the database before picking a random record. Therefore, it is recommended to use the `order()` and `limit()` methods for larger collections.

The Klingon language was created specifically for the Star Trek franchise, and as such, has a limited vocabulary. However, based on the existing Klingon vocabulary, you could translate the phrase "I am hungry and want to eat" as follows:

"chIjDaq yIbuS 'ej ngoghpu'"

Note: This is not an official translation, but rather an approximation based on the available Klingon vocabulary.
